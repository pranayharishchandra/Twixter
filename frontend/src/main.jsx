/* use "mutateAsync" better than "mutate" everywhere tension free that is better

/** mutateAsync
 
** Using mutate instead of mutateAsync is not wrong, but it changes how you handle the mutation. Hereâ€™s a comparison of how you would use each:
Using mutate
With mutate, you handle the mutation in a fire-and-forget manner, typically using callbacks for success and error handling.

** With mutateAsync, you can use ``async/await`` to handle the mutation, which can make the code more readable and easier to manage, especially if you need to perform additional asynchronous operations after the mutation.


The mutateAsync function is similar to mutate, but it returns a promise, allowing you to use async/await syntax for better control over asynchronous operations. Here's a brief comparison:

**  1. mutate
Usage: Typically used for fire-and-forget operations.
Returns: Nothing (void).
** Example:
    mutate(formData, {
        onSuccess: () => {
            // Handle success
        },
        onError: (error) => {
            // Handle error
        }
    });

** 2. mutateAsync
Usage: Used when you need to await the mutation and handle the result or error in a more controlled manner.
Returns: A promise that resolves with the mutation result or rejects with an error.
** Example:
    try {
        const result = await mutateAsync(formData);
        // Handle success
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle error
    }

/* HOW TO USE REACT QUERY
* Mutation State: 
"isCommenting" and "isLiking" should be used to check if the mutation is in progress to prevent multiple submissions.

* Initial State: 
The mutation state variables (isCommenting and isLiking) are initially false and become true when the mutation starts, and back to false once it ends.


* *** HOW TO USE IT ***
* Initial Check: 
The if (isCommenting) return; ensures the function exits if a comment is already being posted.
* Mutation Execution: 
commentPost() or likePost() ``triggers`` the mutation, setting isCommenting or isLiking to true immediately.

/**  VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPT
** ========================================================================
// First Component
const { data: authUser, isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["authUser"],
**  queryFn: async () => {
        const res = await fetch("/api/auth/me");
        const data = await res.json();
        if (!res.ok) throw new Error(data.error || "Something went wrong");
        return data;
    },
});

// Second Component
const { data: authUser } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["authUser"],
**  // No queryFn here, will use the cached data fetched by the first component
});

** ========================================================================

** ========================:Conclusion:========================
** Both components with the same queryKey will share the same data.
** The queryFn in the first component will fetch the data and cache it.
** The second component will use the cached data without needing its own queryFn.

/*  QUESTION 1 refetchOnWindowFocus
* 1. refetchOnWindowFocus Default Value:
Yes, the default value of refetchOnWindowFocus in React Query (or TanStack Query) is true. This means that by default, queries will refetch their data when the window regains focus.

* 2. Behavior When Changing Tabs or Desktop:
Yes, if refetchOnWindowFocus is set to true (which is the default), then the query will refetch when you switch tabs or desktops and then return to the original tab. This can lead to the data being re-fetched and the components using that data being re-rendered.
 */

/* Will it create ambiguity?
* 2) Question:
You are using useQuery with queryKey: ["authUser"] in two different components. 
Is this the same function? 
What if you write some other function with the same query key? 
Will it create ambiguity?

* Answer:

Key Points:

Same Query Key Across Components:

Yes, the same query key ["authUser"] will refer to the same cached data.
React Query manages a global cache and associates data with the provided query key.
Using Different Query Functions:

If you define a different function for the same query key, the result might be inconsistent.
Ideally, use the same function or ensure both functions return consistent data.
Best Practices:

Define a central function (like in a separate api.js file) and import it wherever needed.
Ensure the query function for queryKey: ["authUser"] is the same across components to avoid ambiguity and inconsistency.
